Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm passionate about leveraging quantitative techniques to solve complex problems in Finance and Risk Management, with a strong focus on asset and derivatives pricing, and developing and evaluating trading strategies.

## üìà Projects & Focus Areas

Here's a glimpse of what you'll find in my repositories:

* **Asset Pricing:**
    * Implementation of various pricing models (e.g., Black-Scholes, Monte Carlo simulations, Binomial Lattice).
    * Analysis of market data to identify pricing inefficiencies.
    * Factor model development and analysis.
* **Derivatives Pricing:**
    * Pricing exotic options and structured products.
    * Volatility modeling and forecasting.
    * Interest rate derivatives analysis.
<!--* **Trading Strategies:**
    * Development and backtesting of algorithmic trading strategies.
    * Risk management and portfolio optimization.
    * Statistical arbitrage strategies.  -->
* **Risk Management:**
    * Value at Risk (VaR), Conditional VAR (CVAR)<!-- and Expected shortfall (ES) calculations -->.
    * Gaussian Copula
    * CDS pricing, swaps pricing
* **Fixed Income Securities:**
    * Implementation of pricing models for various securities.
    * Analysis of market data to identifying inefficiencies and term structure.
    * Binomial lattice models to help with the intuitive understanding.
